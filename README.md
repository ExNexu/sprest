## Sprest - REST easy with Spray ##

Sprest is a collection of libaries to make building REST services simpler using [Spray](http://spray.io).

Even though it is very easy to build REST services with Spray out of the box, as a learning exercise I decided to build some libraries to make working with specific technologies easier.

## Libraries ##

**sprest-core** - required by other sprest libraries. Defines model and DAO conventions as well as provides REST routing generators.

**sprest-slick** - provides [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) DAO implementation.

**sprest-reactivemongo** - TODO - will provide [ReactiveMongo](http://reactivemongo.org/) DAO implementation.
